#### **Step 1: Login to the Mattermost Admin Console**

2. Log in with an account that has System Admin permissions.

#### **Step 2: Navigate to the Plugin Management Section**

2. Click **Upload Plugin** to open a file selection dialog.
3. Select the `.tar.gz` or `.zip` file of the plugin from your local system.

#### **Step 4: Wait for the Upload to Complete**
1. Once uploaded, Mattermost will automatically unpack the plugin and check its validity.
2. If the upload is successful, the plugin will appear in the list of installed plugins.
   - If an error occurs (e.g., version incompatibility), it's displayed immediately. Address the error and retry the upload.

1. Inform your team or test the plugin functionality yourself.
2. Depending on the plugin, it may add options in the user interface, commands in message boxes, or integrations with external services.

### **Troubleshooting**
- **Plugin Fails to Upload:** Ensure the plugin file is compatible with the Mattermost server version.
- **Plugin Fails to Enable:** Check server logs via the **System Console** -> **Logs** section for error messages.
- **Performance Issues:** Disable the plugin temporarily and contact the plugin developer.

### **Automated Plugin Installation (Optional)**

```bash
# Example for CLI
mattermost plugin install <path_to_plugin_file>
```
